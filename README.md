# manual_cloud_save
when the cloud save is not available

Just replace the path vars (source / destination) in the header of the file and there you go !

# Exemple : 

Replace : 

set source="%USERPROFILE%\Documents\SavedGames\One Finger Death Punch\Game_Save\Player1\One_Finger_Death_Punch_Save.sav"

set destination="D:\Google Drive\Perso\save_onefingerpunch\One_Finger_Death_Punch_Save.sav"

By your own paths.

Enjoy !
